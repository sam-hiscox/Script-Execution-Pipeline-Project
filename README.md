![GitHub commit activity](https://img.shields.io/github/commit-activity/w/sam-hiscox/Script-Execution-Pipeline-Project)


## Description

This repository is used to store all the public code components of the EPA for my Level 4 DevOps apprenticeship.

## Overview

The projects aim was to streamline a very manual process of handling data fix support tickets. The existing procedure is not only time-consuming but also poses security risks and is susceptible to human error. By automating the process using DevOps tools and methodologies, I have delivered improvements in efficiency, security, reliability, whilst also adding extra monitoring and alerting.
